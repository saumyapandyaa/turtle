	 * The image is in grayscale (black and white), so the colours are numbers
	 * from [0-255] where 0 is black, 255 is white, and the values in between
	 * are varying levels of gray.
	 *
	 * You need to understand how the (x,y) values are stored so you know how
	 * they should be updated when you move (down means y increases, etc). You do
	 * not need to use the 'im' variable for anything other than passing it into
	 * the drawLine() function described below.
	 *
	 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 *
	 * Here's the setup - There is a turtle (with a pen) that walks along the
	 * image. When the pen is down (on the paper), it draws a line along the path
	 * that it walks on. (If you want to play around with this, consider looking
	 * at the `turtle` library in python!)
	 *
	 * The turtle initially starts at pixel (0, 0) [at the top left],
	 * facing right (in the positive x direction). The pen starts off
	 * as `down`, with the default colour being black (0).
	 *
	 * You need to go through the linked list and 'run' the commands to keep
	 * track of the turtles position, and draw the appropriate lines. Here is
	 * what each command should do:
	 *
	 *  - penup          : Put the pen up (stop drawing)
	 *  - pendown        : Put the pen down (start / continue drawing)
	 *  - colour <val>   : Draw lines in colour <val> from now on
	 *  - forward <val>  : Move the turtle forward <val> steps (pixels)
	 *                     in the direction it is facing.
	 *  - backward <val> : Same as above, except move backwards
	 *  - right          : Turn the turtle to the right by 90 degrees
	 *  - left           : Turn the turtle to the left by 90 degrees
	 *
	 * NOTE: Make sure that you do *not* go outside the image. For this, set the
	 * maximum and minimum values of x and y to be 0 and SIZEX-1 / SIZEY-1
	 * respectively.
	 *
	 * For instance, if the turtle is at (0,0) facing right, and your command is
	 * `forward 100000`, it will only go forward till (SIZEX-1, 0), and end
	 * up at the rightmost pixel in that row.
	 *
	 * IMPORTANT: Once you are done with all the commands, make sure you save the
	 * final (x,y) location of the turtle into the variables endX and endY.
	 *
	 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
	 *
	 * We have already implemented a drawLine() function (in imgUtils.c) which
	 * you should use to actually draw the lines. It takes in the following:
	 *
	 *      - a pointer to an image struct (use 'im')
	 *      - (x,y) location of start point
	 *      - (x,y) location of end point
	 *      - a colour to draw the line in [0-255]
	 *
	 * Note that this function only draws horizontal and vertical lines, so
	 * either the x values or the y values of both points must be the same.
	 * Both these points *must* also be within the image.
	 *          [ 0 <= x < SIZEX,  0 <= y < SIZEY ]
